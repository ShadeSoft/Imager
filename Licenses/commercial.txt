ShadeSoft Imager Commercial License
===================================

Imager is licensed under the GPL v3.0, LGPL v3.0, MPL v2.0 and/or the
"ShadeSoft Imager Commercial License" (SICL).
This document describes the SICL.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The license is non-exclusively granted to a single person or company, per
payment of the license fee, for the lifetime of that person or company.
The license is non-transferrable.

The SICL grants the licensee the right to use Imager in commercial
closed-source projects. Modifications may be made to Imager with no
obligation to release the modified source code.
Imager (or pieces thereof) may be included in any number of projects
authored (in whole or in part) by the licensee.

The licensee may use any version of Imager, past, present or future, as is
most convenient. This license does not entitle the licensee to receive any
technical support, updates of bugfixes, except as such are made publicly
available to all Imager users.

The licensee may not sub-license Imager itself, meaning that any
commercially released product containing all or parts of Imager must have
added functionality beyond what is available in Imager; Imager itself may
not be re-licensed by the licensee.
